In this lab, we’ll install all of the required dependencies, fetch the WordPress source files from their release page, and automatically install a new instance.

At this point, you can run `vagrant destroy` and then `vagrant up` to destroy your environment and spin it up as an empty box. Ansible will run and automatically provision your WordPress install for you. It may take a few minutes, as it’s installing all of your dependencies as well as configuring WordPress.

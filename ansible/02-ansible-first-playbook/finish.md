## Conclusion
Congratulations! You just put together your first playbook.

If you've come to the end and you'd like to repeat the scenario, you can. Simply refresh your browser and begin again. Or, feel free to go back and test your own theories, using the established playbook.

Summarizing what we learned:<br>
- We learned how to install Ansible on a Linux host machine
- We also learned to write a barebones playbook and to run that playbook using ansible-playbook
- We discovered how to use the ping module to test our connection and the apt module to install packaged services
- After testing our installations, we learned how a good playbook, is a simplified one, and how we can use {with_items} to combine installation requests

In coming labs, we'll return to this simply playbook and we'll launch a WordPress blog from off the back of the same code you've just written. With Ansible, it doesn't take much to build something great, and you're on your way now!

### Introduction
In the previous lab you learned how to connect your host, to a targeted host machine. Now, you'll start off from a host, install Ansible on it, and execute commands on the localhost. The difference is you'll be running your commands from a playbook, using the `ansible-playbook` command.

###### Understanding the Development Environment
This is built on an Ubuntu 14.04 base instance, so this is Linux. There is nothing currently installed, but the essentials, which we've installed already for you. You'll have a terminal and an editor window, just like in the previous lab. Your commands and editor update automatically, but you can interact with them both and make changes manually.

###### Installing Ansible
Your first job will be to install Ansible on the host machine. Before, we used container technology to setup a container where Ansible was already installed, this time you'll learn what it takes to install Ansible on a Linux host machine.

###### Bare Essentials Playbook
You can't learn about Ansible without learning about playbooks! In this lab you'll get your first taste of running commands with Ansible that are predefined in a `playbook.yml` file.

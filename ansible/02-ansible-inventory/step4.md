At this point, you can log in to your virtual machine to make sure that everything is installed as you would expect it to be.

1. Like before, to do this, you run vagrant ssh to log in. Then, you can run a few commands to check whether certain programs are installed:

# which php

Output:

/usr/bin/php

# which nginx

Output:

/usr/sbin/nginx

# which mysqld

Output:

/usr/sbin/mysqld

2. Before moving forward, be sure to exit the instance by typing exit
